# unit-4-game


This is a game that randomizes a number between 19-120. Then the user will recieve 4 crystals with a random number between 1-12.
The user will then be challenged to use the random values generated by the chrystals and add it up to equal the amount of the random number to match.

If the user succesfully adds up the chrystals then they will be awarded a win. Otherwise, if the user goes over the Generated number they will be assigned a loss.
